				<h2>How it works</h2>
				<p>Most systems for to-do lists either track when tasks are due or when you want to do them, but not both.</p>
				<p>Offloader takes care of both at once, with a simple workflow:<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Record a task</li>
					<li>Plan it on your calendar</li>
				</ol>
				<p>It's as simple as that.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='container-sm text-left'>
				<h3>Workflow details</h3>
				<h4>Record a task</h4>
				<p>As soon as you get an assignment, begin a project, remember an errand to run, or have an idea,
				add it into Offloader. You'll note some of the most important details &ndash; what it is, when its due, how long you think
				it will take &ndash; and then if you want, you can attach a note or even a picture, and that's it.</p>
				<p>This step should be easy and painless. Don't worry about being too detailed or accurate, just make sure you've offloaded
				enough that you no longer have to remember what the task was.</p>

				<h4>Plan it on the calendar</h4>
				<p>Later, once you sit down for the day or have time to plan ahead a little, you should come back to Offloader
				to plan your task. To do so, you'll pull up your list of tasks, where any unplanned tasks will be listed at the
				top.</p>
				<p>Then, pull up your calendar by selecting a task. Click and drag between two times on the calendar to plan the
				task for that block of time.</p>

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>There is one sure-fire way to introduce more disorganization into the life of a person with ADHD &ndash; 
				marrying another person who has it. This has led my spouse and I to look for as many ways as possible to offload the responsibility
				of executive function to systems more capable than we are, but a good method of tracking homework assignments has
				eluded us.</p>
				<p>We find it helpful to use a shared calendar, but face the same dilemma at the start of every semester. Do you
				put an event where the assignment is due or where you plan to do it? On top of that, it's fairly cumbersome to
				enter events in a system like that. A due-date is a point in time, so do I just enter it as a 15-minute event?
				When do I want reminders? A notification telling me my 6-hour project is due in 1 hour is not very helpful, but
				it's a hassle to customize the reminder notifications for every single assignment I get.</p>
				<p>Because of this, I wanted a task management system that:
					<ul>
						<li>Tracks both due date and when I would work on it</li>
						<li>Understands that long tasks should be started earlier</li>
						<li>Allows splitting tasks into multiple blocks of time on the calendar</li>
						<li>Makes adding tasks frictionless, so I could add all my assignments while sitting in class</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
